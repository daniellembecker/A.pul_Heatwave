# Protocol for sampling from fragments and colonies of *Acropora* sp. during the marine heatwave experiment

## All photos, metadata sheets, and data can be found on the [Acropora_Sampling Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16MRkEmqtexqxClifcpm9qUH9ATkP6NHS).

## All data sheet photos and raw data should be uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f0I4fi72gqcFtxoOj08j3n1DRL2GLVKw) as well as to [this repository](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis).

1. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**
    - Quart-size plastic bags
    - Sharpies
    - Mesh collection bags
		- 1-2 for each sampling team to hold supplies
		- 3 to hold phys frags in water from boat
    - Underwater camera and color standard (RGB) with ruler
    - Stainless steel bone cutters
    - Hammer and chisel
    - GPS (in plastic bag) - recommend one unit per sampling team **make sure battery is full**
    - Dive flag if flotation needed and people are sampling far from the boat
		- *Note: dive flag on buoy with anchor/weight that can be towed by snorkeler may be best, and GPS unit (in waterproof case) can be attached to flag above surface*
    - Extra zipties and aluminum numbered tags
    - Extra batteries for camera and GPS
    - Patch site map printed on waterproof paper
    - Pencil
    - Clipboard 
    - Large coolers
    - Buckets


2. <a name="Preparations"></a> **Preparations**
    - **If you need to put out HOBO temperature loggers, follow the [HOBO temperature logger deployment protocol](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2020-01-11-Logger_Protocol.md)**
    - Print out the [patch site map](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nOItJ262IWRvqQPDclx_jc78P00m0_mS) on underwater paper before sampling.
    - Prelabel one quart-sized plastic bag (for physiological fragments) for each colony to be sampled with species, colony number, and date (format yyyy_mm_dd).
        - *Note: sharpie comes off of plastic bags easily in the water. Use the laser paper stickers to add a sticker label with a number written in sharpie inside the bag.

3. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**
    - Drive to site and anchor at recommended anchorage coordinates
    - Navigate to colony patch using GPS
    - Sample from the five different patches equally and 12 distinct genotype coral colonies (connected at the base) that are ~20 inches in width that will be split into 3 colonies that are reproductively viable size (n=24).
    - Using a hammer and chisel, remove each colony of origin from the substrate, split it evenly into three colonies, being careful not to remove any colonies with tags or cause damage to the coral patch.
    - One colony will be used for the ambient treatment, one colony will be used for hot, and one will be used for the timepoint sampling fragments
    - For bleaching score, first take a clear photo of the metal tag up close. Then, take a photo of each individual colony with the color standard ruler clear view.

- *Acropora* timepoint sampling
    - Use bone-cutters to clip 12 ~5 cm intact branches with apical polyp from the timepoint sampling colony.
    - Place fragments in quart size bag full of water and seal it.
    - Seal quart bag with seawater inside.
    - Place into mesh bag(s) inside a cooler or covered container that is full of fresh seawater (fill right before you leave the site) in the boat to keep out of sunlight and to avoid exposing them to high temperature.
    
- Drive back to lab and store samples in a water table to keep samples temperature controlled. Check that all bags are filled with water and make sure the labels are clearly visible and no fragements tip out of the bags.  
- Place the two full colonies into their respective flow through treatments 
- Glue all timepoint sampling fragments (n = 144) onto acrylic coral plugs and place into respective ambient or hot treatments
