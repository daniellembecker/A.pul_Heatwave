    -  Dry shipper
    -  -80C freezer
    -  Waterproof paper
    -  Zipties
    -  Sharpies
    -  Scissors
    -  Stainless Steel Bone cutters
    -  Physiology samples
    -  Molecular samples

2. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**  

**Prior to sampling, prepare all materials, chemicals, and label tubes. Bring in corals once ready for sampling and all other preparation is complete.**

- Total tubes needed for protocol below: 
    -  N = 80 5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for histological sampling processing, details below
    -  N = 80 2 mL screw cap microcentrifuge tubes (1 for RNA/DNA, 1 for snap freezing)

-  **Histological sample processing**

    -  Label individual 5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with the species name, tag ID, date, sampling method, and replicate for colonies collected using the sample spread sheet as a reference. Label two tubes per colony (rep 1 and rep 2). With N=40 colonies, you will have N=80 tubes.  
      - Example: A. pulchra : 465 : 2021/12/10 : HISTO : 1 and A. pulchra : 465 : 2021/12/10 : HISTO : 2  
    - Fill 5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with 2 mL of 10% formalin.
    - Depending on sampling time, you can bring the corals inside in batches while leaving the rest in the water table/tank. It may be convenient to bring in ~10 colony samples at a time. When sampling, open the bag, empty the seawater (into the sink or a bucket) and place the sample on a paper towel on the counter.  
    - Use the stainless steel bone cutters to cut off ~0.5-1 inch off the base of the physiology fragments (n = 2 per colony) for histological analysis (avoid the apical tip).
    - Preserve samples in fixed formalin tube, parafilm top of tubes, put into a box labeled **Becker_Gametogenesis_Putnam: Sampling Month and Year: Histological_Samples: Contact +18479174355** cover top of tube with parafilm, and store in 4°C for long term storage.
    - In between sampling each fragment, rinse the clippers in 70% ethanol.

-  **Molecular sample processing**

    -  Label duplicate 2 mL screw cap microcentrifuge tubes with the species name, tag ID, date, sampling method, and replicate for colonies collected using the sample spread sheet as a reference. Label two tubes per colony (rep 1 and rep 2). With N=40 colonies, you will have N=80 tubes.  
      - Example: A. pulchra : 465 : 2021/12/10 :  RNA/DNA : 1  and A. pulchra : 465 : 2021/12/10 : SNAP : 2  
    - Fill one microcentrifuge tube with 1-2 ml of RNA DNA Shield depending on coral size (for larger pieces, use 2 mL). The other microcentrifuge tube will be left empty for snap freezing.
    - After collecting samples for histology, sample for molecular.  
    - Use the stainless steel bone cutters to cut off two ~0.5-1 cm pieces off the base of the physiology fragments (n = 2 per colony) for molecular analysis (avoid the apical tip). Place 1 fragment in RNA/DNA shield 1-2 ml of RNA DNA Shield depending on coral size and one in an empty tube for snap freezing. Parafilm top of tubes. Freeze both tubes, put into a box labeled **Becker_Gametogenesis_Putnam: Sampling Month and Year: Molecular_RNA/DNA_Snap_Samples: Contact +18479174355** and store in freezer.  
    - Store tubes in -40°C until return to URI and then store at -80°C
    - In between sampling each fragment, rinse the clippers in 70% ethanol.  

-  **Physiological sample processing**

	-  Take the remaining fragment and place into individually labeled whirl paks (n = 1 per bag) and freeze in -80 C.  
	-  Empty the seawater in the sink. Clean the counter and supplies with 70% ethanol. 
	-  Record notes and time of sampling for all samples.
