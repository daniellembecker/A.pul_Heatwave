# Daily Measurement Protocol - Moorea E5  

Original: 20220924   
Last Revised: 20220929  

# Overivew  

## This protocol lists the daily measurement proceedures for taking daily tank measurements in the Gametogenesis Heatwave Experiment on the 24 tanks holding *Acropora pulchra* colonies.

The daily measurements that are included in this protocol are:  
1. Flow rate (mL / 10 sec)  
2. pH (mV)  
3. Conductivity (psu)  
4. Temperature (C)  
5. Light (PAR)  

The data sheet will have the following headers:  

| Date  | Time | Tank.ID | pH (mV) | Temperature (C) | conductivity |  Flow (mL / 5 sec) initial  |  Flow (mL / 5 sec) final | PAR.center | PAR.q1 | PAR.q2 | PAR.q3 | PAR.q4 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |  ------------ |  ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | 

The probe container looks like this:

## 1. Flow Rate  

1. Place a 500 mL nalgene bottle or other container with graduation marks under the water drain for each tank. Set a stopwatch for 5 sec and fill the falcon tube/bottle. Record the mL of water in a datasheet for daily measurements ("flow initial".   

2. After all tanks have been measured, adjust water flow if necessary to obtain similar flow in each tank.  

3. If flow is changed, measure flow again in all tanks ("flow final").  

## 2. pH (mV) and conductivity (psu)   

Before the start of the experiment, conduct a Tris calibration as described in the [Putnam Lab protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols/GSO_Wetlab_Protocols.md#II-Tris-Calibration).  

Use the Orion Mettler Toledo probe to measure pH and conductivity in the center of all tanks.  

### pH measurements
1. Press the power on the Orion meter to turn the probe on
2. Rinse the tip of the probe with DI water. Careful, this is a glass electrode probe.  
3. Toggle the "channel" button (F3) to make sure you are viewing pH in **mV**  
4. Submerge the tip of the probe in each tank to take recording. Do not submerge the probes too far to avoid corrosion or short-circuiting connections. Press "mesaure".  
5. When the probe settles (will say "ready") record the pH in the lab notebook
6. Repeat steps 4 & 5 for each tank.
7. Record temperature at the same time, see below.  

### Conductivity measurements (salinity)

NOTE: salinity and pH measurements can be done at the same time  

1. Press the power button to turn the probe on
2. Toggle the "channel" button (F3) to make sure you are viewing salinity (conductivity) in **psu**
3. Place the probe in the tank. Make sure the whole conductivity cell is submerged in the water The conductivity probe needs to be positioned below water just enough that the cell/opening is submerged. Press "measure".  
4. When the probe settles (will say "ready") record the salinity in the lab notebook
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 for all replicate tanks and head tanks.
6. Press the power button to turn the probe off. 

## 3. Temperature (C)  

1. Press the "ON/OFF" button to turn the probe on.
2. Place the tip/metal portion of the probe in the tank.
3. When the probe settles within 0.1C, record the temperature in the lab notebook
4. Repeat for all replicate tanks and head tanks.
NOTE: record all temperature measurements in Celsius. 
5. Press the "ON/OFF" button to turn the probe off. 
6. Record temperature at the same time as pH/conductivity.  

## 5. Light (PAR)    

1. Press the power button on the Apogee light sensor. 
2. Take the plastic cover off of the light sensor.  
3. Place the sensor in the water facing upwards at the depth of the corals *at the center of the tank*.  
4. Record the light level. 
5. Now record the light level in the *center of each of four quandrants in the tank* (see photo below). 
6. This will result in 5 light measurements in each tank.  
7. Turn the probe off.

## Clean up  

After all measurements, rinse all probes with DI water and then wipe equipment with alcohol wipes to remove any seawater and moisture. Store the pH probe in the solution cap and store all probes and equipment in plastic bags in the lab.
